## Session: 2026-02-09

### Summary
Completed resume content updates and fixed Claude Code skills configuration.

### Changes
- Verified resume content on Resources page now matches PDF (all bullet points included)
- Cleaned up temp_commit_message.txt
- Fixed skills directory structure: moved from flat `.md` files to proper `<skill>/SKILL.md` format
  - wrap-up, check, new-page skills now auto-discovered by Claude Code

### Notes
- Skills now work with `/wrap-up`, `/check`, `/new-page` commands
- All previous session work (CTAs, breakpoints, resume) already committed and pushed
