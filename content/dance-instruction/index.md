Karen (she/her) was ﬁrst seen on stage at age 9 performing a tap dance to "Lollipop" in a striped leotard and has been dancing ever since. She discovered Lindy Hop during the Swing craze in 1998 and has never looked back. She has since traveled all over the country and throughout Europe to perform, compete, and teach at international events. She has earned titles competing at events such as Lindy Focus, the Lone Star Championships, the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown, the Boston Tea Party, the U.S. Open, and Camp Jitterbug. She feels most honored to have received the first ever "Spirit of Lindy Hop" awards at both Camp Jitterbug in Seattle, WA (2005), and the International Lindy Hop Championships in Washington, D.C. (2010). Karen currently teaches regularly with Boston Lindy Hop and in Providence, RI. Her classes are typically sweat-inducing with a joyfully silly vibe. She is a stickler for good technique but will also force you to have fun.
